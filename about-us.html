I've always been good at technology, be it using software, editing videos, among many other things. When I heard about F1 In Schools, I though it was a great initiative, and I instantly knew I could contribute to this project. I'm the Software Engineer, so I'm responsible for finding technological solutions that are both current and productive to provide for our necessities.
